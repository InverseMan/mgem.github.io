#Week 14- Troubleshooting: Did You Try Turning it Off and then On again?

Welcome back everyone! This week’s entry is the penultimate entry and my last entry in our blog series. It has been such a great experience writing this series, and I know I speak for me and Max when I say we really appreciate all of you who have followed our series until now. I hope these weekly schpeels have helped you learn about synbio!

Today we will talk about the inevitable step of troubleshooting. Now that you know about all the procedures, I’m sure you already have an idea as to the potential places where mistakes may occur. Below are just some pieces of advice and suggestions in troubleshooting to find and deal with these errors. I myself am still a beginner in troubleshooting, and I’m sure that I will learn many more things as I gain more experience in synbio and wet lab work in general. But come, let us explore the first steps to troubleshooting!

---------------------------

So you have just finished your ligations, and you’re feeling pretty good about approaching the end of another round of cloning. True to proper scientific procedure you run a gel on the ligation products to confirm the band sizes. But when you look at the gel, GASP. The bands don’t match, in fact they are not close in size at all! What do you do?

Well, the first thing is to try and interpret your results. Yes you got something unexpected, but how is it unexpected? What could it mean? Perhaps the bands match the un-ligated DNA, or even the undigested DNA. Or if there are no bands at all, perhaps check your sample tubes – did you forget to add DNA to one of the mixtures? Perhaps the miniprep did not work properly. But don’t panic right away! You might want to decide whether to run the procedure again. Check your samples, perhaps switch out your agarose solution when re-running your gel. Sometimes, you just forgot to add a DNA sample, or waited too long before checking your gels. Sometimes the same transformation doesn’t work the first time, but works the second time. Trying again is basically the “did you trying turning it off then on again?” of synbio procedures.

But of course, if you keep getting unexpected results, don’t just keep repeating the experiment blindly! At this point you need to start making hypotheses and thinking about how to identify and then solve your problem. For example, did you use the right buffer for ligation? Is your DNA ligase expired, or was it stored improperly? Perhaps there was a problem in the digestion phase (again, consider enzymes, buffer, etc), or maybe the PCR primer designs were flawed. A helpful tip is to check the storage and age of all your DNA samples, buffers, and enzymes. When were they purchase or mini-prepped? How were they stored? This is where those dates on the sample tubes really come in handy, as well as that detailed lab book that you’re supposed to keep of your progress! Maybe check your primer sequences as well. Were they designed properly? Are you sure you used the sequence from the correct ‘side’ so to speak (sense versus anti-sense)? Look back at your results, and see if they match any of these scenarios.

Once you have decided on a possible theory, you might want to test it out. Perhaps you decide it’s probably a problem with the buffer. Try the procedure again with another acceptable buffer, and see if you get the results you want. Perhaps it’s the primer, so you re-design and order a new batch. In some circumstances however, you might want to design an experiment to narrow it down a bit more. For example, if you suspect that a digestion enzyme used in 3a assembly was denatured, it is not very cost-effective or efficient to replace all 4 digestion enzymes and re-do the experiment. It would also be a waste of the other 3 functional enzyme batches. In this case, perhaps you want to design a sequential experiment where you test the 4 enzymes and run gels to find the one that is not functional (if it exists).

The troubleshooting process is basically asking yourself a series of questions on your experimental procedure and how you carried it out. There is no easy way to troubleshoot, and it is not uncommon to try out several alternatives but still not achieve the result you want. It is important to understand the procedure you are doing, and the places where changes can occur which lead to errors. Doing the procedure is only half the story! Troubleshooting is what makes you a true researcher.

So keep learning, keep trying, and keep troubleshooting! Once again, it has truly been a great experience writing this blog series. Look forward to Max’s entry and the conclusion of this series, and new content on our blog coming in the near future as we start on the road to iGEM 2016!
