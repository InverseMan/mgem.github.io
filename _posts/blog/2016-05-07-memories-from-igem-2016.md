The Giant Jamboree is an international gathering of representatives from undergraduate iGEM teams, a platform to present our project after the hard work and effort we have put throughout the past year. It’s where we share and exchange ideas, celebrate our contributions to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, and explore the ever expanding field of synthetic biology. As we start lab work for our 2016 iGEM project, many of our new team members have been curious about last year’s Jamboree. Let’s look back to 2015 and see what some of our team members have to say about their experience!
