The Giant Jamboree is an international gathering of representatives from undergraduate iGEM teams, a platform to present our project after the hard work and effort we have put throughout the past year. It’s where we share and exchange ideas, celebrate our contributions to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, and explore the ever expanding field of synthetic biology. As we start lab work for our 2016 iGEM project, many of our new team members have been curious about last year’s Jamboree. Let’s look back to 2015 and see what some of our team members have to say about their experience!

My name is Fei Fei, and you may remember me from the [first mGEM blog series](http://mcmastergem.com/blog/2015/08/17/a-fledgling-guide-to-syn-bio/). I’m here with Max, Karanbir, and Michael. Please introduce yourselves!    

![Max](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13153468_10206253350636012_1466451684_n.png?oh=6f254ec0d297e10243d6861e44d906dd&oe=5732688C "Max") Max: Hello! My name’s Max, and you might also remember me from the first mGEM blog series! Last year I spent the summer working in the mGEM lab and this year I am the team manager.    

![Karanbir](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13152773_10206253363916344_437115623_n.png?oh=8ec41b87d583f1a384ea11e4f84ac544&oe=57315EE4 "Karanbir") Karanbir: I’m Karanbir, and I was involved in obtaining the funding for our project as well as helping complete some experiments and troubleshoot the project during the summer. This year I’m heading the business side of our club and am part of the research team as well.    

![Michael](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13115452_10206253364076348_320125434_n.png?oh=f9b0241bc8e846397299a49f7ea3f278&oe=57314834 "Michael") Michael: Hello, my name is Michael. Last year I helped to plan out the project design and obtaining financial support to fund our project. This year I am an executive and organizing our speaker series.

![Fei Fei](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13153496_10206249919350232_1906714038_n.png?oh=a836a00e71e520ed8af454c355f53d8b&oe=5730A8C3 "Fei Fei") Fei Fei: So what is the first thing you remember now when you think back on the Jamboree?

![Karanbir](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13152773_10206253363916344_437115623_n.png?oh=8ec41b87d583f1a384ea11e4f84ac544&oe=57315EE4 "Karanbir") Karanbir: I remember being in awe at the scope of the event - seeing people from all over the world, including Singapore, China, Germany, Slovenia, and more was incredible. I’d say it is that sense of international collaboration is what resonated with me the most about the Jamboree.

![Michael](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13115452_10206253364076348_320125434_n.png?oh=f9b0241bc8e846397299a49f7ea3f278&oe=57314834 "Michael") Michael: I remember missing the bus stop I was supposed to get off at to. Fortunately I left with about 2 hours to spare in case this happened. But still, it was fairly anxiety inducing.

![Fei Fei](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13153496_10206249919350232_1906714038_n.png?oh=a836a00e71e520ed8af454c355f53d8b&oe=5730A8C3 "Fei Fei") Fei Fei: What was your favourite project from the other teams?

![Michael](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13115452_10206253364076348_320125434_n.png?oh=f9b0241bc8e846397299a49f7ea3f278&oe=57314834 "Michael") Michael: There were many great projects at iGEM. One that stood out to me was [Exeter](http://2015.igem.org/Team:Exeter). Although their full project may not have reached fruition, their initial plan stages and approach to human practice were very impressive. I think it offers an example of how iGEM and synthetic biology can be integrated with the society at large to produce something very useful.

![Karanbir](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13152773_10206253363916344_437115623_n.png?oh=8ec41b87d583f1a384ea11e4f84ac544&oe=57315EE4 "Karanbir") Karanbir: The project that stood out to me most was that of Stanford-Brown. These two schools collaborated over the summer to work at the NASA Astrobiology Institute in Mountain View, California, in order to engineer bacteria for novel applications in spaceflight. I think the reason this project was so impactful in my eyes was because of its unique and creative approach to iGEM - astrobiology as a field was not tackled by any of the other teams. In addition, I thought it was awesome that two schools from across the continent collaborated in such an incredible way - that idea of collaboration is so central to iGEM, and I felt Stanford-Brown embodied it well.

![Fei Fei](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13153496_10206249919350232_1906714038_n.png?oh=a836a00e71e520ed8af454c355f53d8b&oe=5730A8C3 "Fei Fei") Fei Fei: What would be one thing you learned at the conference, research-related or otherwise?

![Michael](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13115452_10206253364076348_320125434_n.png?oh=f9b0241bc8e846397299a49f7ea3f278&oe=57314834 "Michael") Michael: You would think that iGEM would be much like any other research conference where students present generic research. But I saw so much more than that. iGEM does not put restrictions on the type of research you do. Whether it be formal, translational, observational, methodological, or even artistic. I remember seeing projects that were just machines designed to perform a certain task or an art project designed to convey some important aspect of the possible impact of synthetic biology. iGEM truly offers student teams the freedom to do whatever they want and I think it’s a refreshing feeling after all the formal research I’ve participated in. 

![Max](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13153468_10206253350636012_1466451684_n.png?oh=6f254ec0d297e10243d6861e44d906dd&oe=5732688C "Max") Max: I had the opportunity to meet with members of the FBI at a booth during the Giant Jamboree, as well as attend their full presentation later on in the week. Although there is a substantial amount of news on biochemical abuse and weaponization, I hadn’t expected the extent and complexity by which safety measures must be applied. Yes, there are the ‘in-the-field’ moments; however, there are also many subtleties involved. For example, bringing context to flag a possibly deadly shipment, or using a background in the sciences to unravel a tense situation. Essentially, we all have a part to play in keeping our world safe, and though they may seem minor, they can go a long way in preventing disaster.

![Max](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13153468_10206253350636012_1466451684_n.png?oh=6f254ec0d297e10243d6861e44d906dd&oe=5732688C "Max") Max: Have fun, explore, and talk to others! If you have the opportunity to arrive as a large team, take turns at your poster so that you can see and discuss the amazing projects the other teams have been doing as well. And if you can speak the language, do so too! It helps break down barriers and makes for some interesting stories.

![Michael](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13115452_10206253364076348_320125434_n.png?oh=f9b0241bc8e846397299a49f7ea3f278&oe=57314834 "Michael") Michael: Be safe! Enjoy the experience. Take time to explore the city and meet people. It might be stressful at times, but remember to just have fun (:

I can’t wait to go to the Giant Jamboree This year. Hope to see you all there!
