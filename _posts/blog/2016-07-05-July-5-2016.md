Wet Lab
=======

Wet lab has been busy as usual with many new and exciting occurrences. We have finalized our primers and are in the process of placing orders. We have also finalized our two constructs for quorum sensing. They have very interesting names: lux and las. In addition, we are ordering constructs of anti-HER2 DARPIN bound to four different cell wall anchors. We have also cultured our lactobacilli strains and are making electrocompetent cells from L. braves 884. Once the DNA arrives we will do stitch per and transform the finalized plasmid into our electrocompetent cells using electroporation. 

Human Practices
===============

Human practices has also been busy making the magic in wet lab practicable for humans. Through investigations of ethics, laws and regulations, and fundamental economics relevant to current treatments of GI cancers and synthetic biology in Canada, human practices is attempting to predict the feasibility and impact our bacteria will have if they were to be used in the current Canadian health system. 

We will also push to produce a report that presents the general role of synthetic biology in the medical field. This report will look back on the initial stages of synbioâ€™s emergence in medicine, understand its hardships and impacts over the years, and provide our opinions on its current strengths and challenges. 

Community Outreach
==================

In the past year, the Community Outreach subteam has been occupied with planning and brainstorming events that can help to integrate, within the McMaster community, the notions of synthetic biology. Our primary event hosted as a team was the synthetic biology speaker series, where we invited out a few speakers and welcomed them to share their work in this vastly growing field.

Heading into the summer, mGEM began planning for Discovery Day, hosted by Hamilton Health Sciences. This day constitutes a one-day workshop that gives secondary school students the opportunity to explore a variety of careers within the realm of medicine, health, and science. Following Discovery Day at McMaster, the Community Outreach members were busy creating workshop proposals to further involve other secondary school students within Hamilton as a whole.

Currently, our subteam hopes to establish some strong connections within McMaster University and the Hamilton community to continue to educate others on synthetic biology as an emerging field in research. We aim to plan more synthetic biology speaker series in the upcoming school year, and to continue to plan and host events that can better integrate and educate the general population of McMaster and Hamilton.
