Hello and thank you very much for opening this blog post and your subsequently implied interest in McMaster Genetically Engineered Machine! The timing of this post is rather much like the results of many molecular genetic experiments - this wasn’t supposed to happen like this, but it did. Normally, we will hope to have a blog update during the first week of every month. But without further ado, read on to discover what we have been up to for the month of May 2016! 

Wet Lab
=======

Wet lab has been busy as usual. Plates were poured for Amp, Kan, and Cm. Being very eager to start our project, we actually used some biobricks from last year’s iGEM Kit before this year’s kit arrived. The team is currently working on transforming and miniprepping all the relevant parts for our plasmids. Many, like the bacterial quorum sensing components and human IL-2, have already been isolated and await digestion and ligation. We have also secured HER2 tumour cell lines, much to our excitement. Fingers crossed as we move onto ligations and plasmid construction!

Dry Lab 
=======

Dry lab has more or less hashed out a project idea and course of action. We are planning to build a programming language specifically tailored for molecular genetics and genetic engineering, similar to that of SBOL. We have been deciding on a programming platform based on the requirements of the project and the skill set of the team members.

Community Outreach
==================

Community outreach has also been busy lately. In March, McMaster iGem hosted a Synbio speaker series which was our first big event featuring three speakers who talked about their latest advancements in synthetic biology. One of the speakers was the original cofounder of the team Benjamin Scott. The other two speakers were Dr AbouHaidar from UofT and the third was Dr. Bramson from McMaster. After the synbio speaker series the CO sub team began planning workshops to run in high schools in the summer as a result of partnering with HHS in order to maintain a good relationship with them and other potential partners in Hamilton. Please look forward to more events coming up!

Human Practices
===============

Human practices has also been hitting the runway with their first meeting last week. Stay tuned for more updates!
