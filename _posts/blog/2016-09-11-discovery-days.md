On Thursday May 27th, McMaster iGEM hosted two Real Lab Experiences workshops for high school students across the city as part of Discovery Day, run by the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame and the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation in collaboration with McMaster University and St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton. Although it’s been a while since the event, we would like to tell you about the experience, and share some photos!

Our first workshop was on gram staining, and learning about the differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Students had a chance to gram stain their own samples, and see the difference first hand.

Gram-positive bacteria stain dark purple because of they possess a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, which retains the dye. Peptidoglycan is a molecule found only in bacteria, and is recognized by the TLR4 receptor to activate the innate immune response in humans. Gram-negative bacterial stain light pink because they do not have a cell wall, and so do not retain the dye. E. coli is an example of a Gram-negative bacterium. For the workshop, students did cheek swabs to show a variety of cells, and we provided our own cells to demonstrate the staining difference between the Gram-positive and negative cells. Cheek cells, as shown in the microscope images below, can also be viewed using the stains!

Our second workshop was on DNA gel electrophoresis and analysis, and students were able to run load and run DNA samples in gels and interpret their results in small groups in order to solve a murder mystery. Groups had to match the DNA of the victim to DNA found on the murder weapon, getaway vehicle, the killer, and the victim’s relative who will inherit their fortune.

DNA gel electrophoresis is used in forensic identification as well as scientific verification. In both cases we want to determine that certain genes match their expected sizes relative to a DNA ladder to quantitatively confirm their identity. This can be done in order to determine the success of a ligation or PCR reaction, or match two DNA samples for two suspects.

As expected, our brilliant students solved the case with 100% accuracy! In case you were wondering, the murder weapon was the bowling ball, the getaway vehicle was the unmarked white van, the killer was a mime, and the inheritance went to Count Wladnir!

We want to thank all the students and teachers who participated in Discovery Day with us – without you the workshops would not have been nearly as much fun! We hope you enjoyed Discovery Day as much as we did, and learned some things as well. See you all next year!
