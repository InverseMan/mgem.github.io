Hello there! mGEM is proud to introduce a new series of infographics which will be published on our blog and social media sites, and eventually also consolidated on our team wiki page. These infographics will pertain to journal articles on the topic of gastrointestinal cancer and immunotherapy, which are relevant topics in our project this year. We will be publishing them every other week, and they will go from broad to narrow in scope. This week, we learn about the basics of HER2 positive cancers. Beautiful design by Tony Chen. Enjoy!
