Hello again! This week we explore interleukin 2 and the immunological pathways it is involved in. Immunotherapy is an emerging field in cancer therapy. In particular, IL2 causes activation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells and activation of NK cells so that they are able to target tumour cells. Stay tuned for more infographics, and other fun things! This week's infographic is designed by Candy Niu.
