#Week 13: PCR Cleanup

######Déja vu?

We're now at the end of the [PCR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5yPkxCLads) process!
[Last week](http://mcmastergem.com/blog/2015/11/23/the-secret-sauce/) we talked about performing PCR with PCR mixes. Now we'll go through how to extract DNA from the PCR system!

##1. Purifying the PCR Products

So you've calculated, mixed, and run your PCR reaction - great! Now what? Well, unfortunately, nothing's as clean as we wish it was. The PCR product is a jumble of old DNA, new DNA, fragment DNA, enzymes, and other chemicals. Therefore, before we can use our PCR DNA product we've worked so hard for, we need to take a final step to clean it up!

The specific details and numbers from the [ThermoFisher Gel Extraction and DNA Cleanup Protocol](https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/MAN0012670_GeneJET_Gel_Extraction_DNA_Cleanup_Micro_UG.pdf) are hyperlinked. These are what we used; however, since you might be using a different product, we'll be going through the concepts today rather than the numerics.

1. First we will transport and dilute the PCR tube's contents with nuclease-free water in a special DNA Purification Micro Column. This will help use filter out the products. 
2. Then we will add Binding Buffer and ethanol. This will prepare the DNA by binding the DNA to resin, thereby stopping it from being washed out.
3. Centrifuge (speeds up the filtration process).
4. Throw out the flow-through (the solution that was centrifuged to the bottom of the tube).
5. Add Wash Buffer now to help remove stray proteins in the solution as well.
6. Centrifuge again.
7. Throw out the flow-through.
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 again (or as many times as you feel is necessary, but just once again should be enough).
9. Centrifuge without adding anything. This will essentially dry the DNA and remove any remaining impurities (as best as it can).
10. Finally, we add Elution Buffer. This will separate the DNA from the resin and allow the DNA to now flow freely in solution.
11. Centrifuge and *KEEP* the flow-through! This contains your DNA now! However, it contains all the DNA, including the old template DNA and any fragments that were created during the PCR reaction. Therefore, we need to extract only the DNA of interest. Luckily, there's a procedure for that as well: Gel Extraction!

##2. Gel Extraction

Now for Gel Extraction, you're actually familiar with it! The protocol is the same as before from [Week 6 on Gels](http://mcmastergem.com/blog/2015/09/28/gelception/). Head over there if you need a refresher or if you haven't seen that post before - this one's written by Fei Fei a very much worth a read!

Essentially, we add DNA into a gel and run electrophoresis on it. We can thus separate the sizes of DNA based on how far they've travelled in the gel. Because you know the gene you wanted to extract from the beginning (I hope!) you should be able to calculate the length of the gene of interest, and thereby identify the DNA of interest in the gel using the DNA ladder (purchased separately). Now simply cut out that DNA, [purify](http://mcmastergem.com/blog/2015/09/28/gelception/), and voilà! You've obtained your isolated gene of interest!

####Wow that was fast!

Hopefully you've enjoyed reading so far! Unfortunately, PCR in the lab is going to take much longer. For one, PCR cycles take a long time, but problems are also undoubtedly going to arise. That's why for next week, Fei Fei will be telling you all about troubleshooting in your experiments!

So come back next week as we approach the end of Phase 2! If you have a question or comment, leave us a message below! We'll see you next week!
