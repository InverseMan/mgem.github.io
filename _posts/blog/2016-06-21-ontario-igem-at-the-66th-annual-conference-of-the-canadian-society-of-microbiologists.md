On June 14th 2016, McMaster iGEM attended our seasonal Ontario iGEM (oGEM) meeting to exchange project ideas, give feedback, and network with other Ontario University iGEM Teams. In attendance were teams from University of Toronto (UofT), Queen’s University, University of Waterloo, University of Ottawa, Ryerson University and of course McMaster University.

This year, oGEM was invited to the 66th Annual Conference of the Canadian Society of Microbiologists (CSM), hosted in MacLeod Hall at UofT. We were very honoured to have been given a booth and a presentation timeslot for our projects on behalf of Ontario Genomics.

All of the iGEM teams had great project ideas, and we were very impressed with everyone’s policy and practice initiatives. For example, UofT introduced their Synbio Network initiative, which hopes to connect researchers and faculty across Canada. We are excited to be part of this collaboration, and look forward to sharing information and resources in order to forward this project.

We would also like to give a big thank you to the CSM and all the oGEM teams for insightful questions and valuable feedback on our project presentation. It was extremely helpful for us to hear everyone’s opinions and past experiences.

Our second oGEM meeting this year, it has been a great experience, and we are extremely happy to be moving forward with other Ontario iGEM teams through collaboration. See you at the next oGEM conference!
